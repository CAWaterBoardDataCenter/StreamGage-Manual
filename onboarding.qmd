# Onboarding

Here is a non-comprehensive, but hopefully informative guide to onboarding to the SWAMP Unit. The majority of this information in this section is aimed towards starting at SWAMP as a rank-and-file (non-supervisory) state employee. Please re-reference this page throughout your time at SWAMP!

## HR forms

On your starting day, you will receive a package of forms and documents from the HR department including:

-   Your duty statement
-   Tax forms
-   Direct deposit forms
-   Questionaires (diversity, military)
-   CalPERS forms
-   Leave forms
-   Medical insurance forms

You will also be asked to submit a photocopy of either your passport or a combination of your driver's license and social security card to the HR representative (currently Alicyn Chappelle). All forms apart from the medical insurance forms must be submitted within the first couple of days. Medical insurance forms must be submitted within the first 60 days for you to qualify for enrollment; however, the sooner you submit these forms the sooner you will have health coverage.

## Bargaining units

Each classification within the SWAMP unit is associated with a bargaining unit. The bargaining units, with the State, determine many of the benefits & guidelines described here. For that reason, you should read the latest contract or Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for your bargaining unit to determine benefits as applicable for you. Additional benefits specific to your bargaining unit may exist for you based on the MOU that are not described in this manual. Finally, supervisory positions may have varying benefits beyond those listed in this manual.

| SWAMP Position Classification                     | Bargaining Unit | CBID |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------|
| Scientific Aid                                    | 11              | R11  |
| Environmental Scientist (incl. Senior Specialist) | 10              | R10  |
| AGPA                                              | 1               | R01  |
| Senior Environmental Scientist - Supervisory      | 10              | S10  |

## Leave types

When onboarded, employees in most classifications will be able to select a leave type: **annual leave** vs. **vacation/sick leave**. Comparisons of leave accrual and use between leave types are available in [this chart](https://www.calhr.ca.gov/employees/Pages/vacation-vs-annual-leave-comparison-chart.aspx).

Important FAQ for leave types:

-   You are only allowed to switch leave types every 2 years. Check with our HR liaison about switching leave types.
-   Leave types are also connected to different types of non-work-related disability leave, which may impact your income should you need to go on disability leave. Non-work-related disability leave types are compared for Unit 10 employees on this [flyer](https://capsscientists.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Facts-about-ENDI.pdf). More information about non-work-related disability leave is also available on the EDD [website](https://edd.ca.gov/).
-   Leave accrual can be impacted by the number of days/hours you work in a month.

## Need additional leave?

Under the [Voluntary Personal Leave Program](https://hrmanual.calhr.ca.gov/Home/ManualItem/1/2114), you can exchange a percentage of your salary to accrue additional leave hours per month. See the link above for more information, and contact our personnel specialist for more details.

## CalPERS

CalPERS is the [California Public Employees Retirement System](https://www.calpers.ca.gov/), which you will be enrolled in as a new employee. It provides benefits including medical coverage (health, dental, and vision insurance) and retirement for employees of the state of California.

### Medical coverage

You should select health insurance by submitting the appropriate forms within 60 days of starting with the State. If you select health insurance, you will pay the difference between what the state provides for healthcare (a base amount monthly) and the monthly cost for your selected health insurance. This amount is removed from your monthly paycheck. Employees may elect to receive cash in lieu of their state-sponsored medical insurance and/or dental insurance plan through the [FlexElect](https://www.calhr.ca.gov/state-hr-professionals/Pages/benefits-administration-manual-flexelect.aspx) program. You must certify you have qualifying group health and/or dental insurance through a spouse, domestic partner, or other source. FlexElect cash is distributed monthly.

You can make changes to your health, dental, and vision insurance selections two ways:

1.  Annually during open enrollment, which occurs in the fall of each year. Your new insurance selections begin the following January.
2.  After a [qualifying event](https://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/110-health/30-have/qual-life-events.cfm) in your life.

To learn more about the health coverage available to you, please visit the CalPERS website as well as the website for your [bargaining unit](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/swamp-manual/onboarding.html#bargaining-units) to learn about costs specific to you.

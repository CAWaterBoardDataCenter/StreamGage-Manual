# Onboarding

Here is a non-comprehensive, but hopefully informative guide to onboarding to the SWAMP Unit. The majority of this information is aimed towards starting at SWAMP as a state employee. Please re-reference this page throughout your time at SWAMP!

## HR forms

On your starting day, you will receive a package of forms and documents from the HR department including:

-   Your duty statement
-   Tax forms
-   Direct deposit forms
-   Questionaires (diversity, military)
-   CalPERS forms
-   Leave forms
-   Medical insurance forms

You will also be asked to submit a photocopy of either your passport or a combination of your driver's license and social security card to the HR representative (currently Alicyn Chappelle). All forms apart from the medical insurance forms must be submitted within the first couple of days. Medical insurance forms must be submitted within the first 60 days for you to qualify for enrollment; however, the sooner you submit these forms the sooner you will have health coverage.

## Bargaining units

Each classification within the SWAMP unit is associated with a bargaining unit. The bargaining units, with the State, determine many of the benefits & guidelines described here. For that reason, you should read the latest contract or Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for your bargaining unit to determine benefits as applicable for you. Additional benefits specific to your bargaining unit may exist for you based on the MOU that are not described in this manual. Finally, supervisory positions may have varying benefits beyond those listed in this manual.

| SWAMP Position Classification                     | Bargaining Unit | CBID |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------|
| Scientific Aid                                    | 11              | R11  |
| Environmental Scientist (incl. Senior Specialist) | 10              | R10  |
| AGPA                                              | 1               | R01  |
| Senior Environmental Scientist - Supervisory      | 10              | S10  |

## Leave types

When onboarded, employees in most classifications will be able to select a leave type: **annual leave** vs. **vacation/sick leave**. Comparisons of leave accrual and use between leave types are available in [this chart](https://www.calhr.ca.gov/employees/Pages/vacation-vs-annual-leave-comparison-chart.aspx).

Important FAQ for leave types:

-   You are only allowed to switch leave types every 2 years. Check with our HR liaison about switching leave types.
-   Leave types are also connected to different types of non-work-related disability leave, which may
    impact your income should you need to go on disability leave. Non-work-related disability leave types are compared for Unit 10 employees on this [flyer](https://capsscientists.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Facts-about-ENDI.pdf). More information about non-work-related disability leave is also available on the EDD [website](https://edd.ca.gov/).
-   Leave accrual can be impacted by the number of days/hours you work in a month.

# Equipment CheckList

The ADCP equipment falls into four major buckets: the sensor, the GPS system, the platform, and the motor for the platform. There are many small pieces in the system and you are encouraged to put everything together and check operation before heading out into the field.

The complete setup with components is shown in the figure below.

## Inventory and Gear Checkout

Here is a [list of items that were purchased](https://cawaterboards.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/WB-DWR-UASProgram/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B76A62C99-94CF-42B1-A99C-8D655CD2AA5C%7D&file=RiverSurveyor_Parts_List.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) in 2024 when the equipment was brand new. The equipment must be reserved and checked out on the [DWR Reserve Equipment page](https://cawaterboards.sharepoint.com/sites/WB-DWR-UASProgram/SitePages/ProjectHome.aspx).

## Pre-Trip Checklist

-   charge rQPOD batteries and rQPOD radio controller
-   get 32 AA batteries and spares for M9
-   gather equipment and turn it on to check that is it functioning
-   review the manuals and equipment list

## Gear List

The following equipment should be gathered and brought to the field when doing ADCP surveys:

-   trucks and all truck safety equipment
-   SPOT beacon (input important numbers before leaving)
-   Personal safety equipment, including life jackets, orange safety vests, and good footwear.

### Streamflow {#streamflowadcplist}

Streamflow measurements with the ADCP require equipment as listed below and the [RiverSurveyor Live! software](streamflow_gettingstarted.qmd) installed on a field computer. The system consists of a platform, a GPS system, and the instrument itself, a Sontek M9. The ADCP can either be controlled with an rQPOD remote-controlled motor, or tethered off a bridge or with ropes from either side.

The rQPOD is shown above, and consists of a motor with two thrusters and radio controller. Information about assembling and using rQPOD can be found on the [rQPOD sharepoint](https://cawaterboards.sharepoint.com/sites/WB-DWR-UASProgram/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FWB%2DDWR%2DUASProgram%2FShared%20Documents%2F01%2DEquipment%2F03%2DManuals%20%26%20Instructions%2FSontek%5FRiver%5FSurveyor%5F%28ADCP%29%2Frqpod%20%28motor%29&viewid=a32c631e%2Db6fc%2D4a60%2D93ef%2D6869b722d57d) and the [manufacturers's website](https://www.xylem.com/en-us/products--services/analytical-instruments-and-equipment/data-collection-mapping-profiling-survey-systems/survey-systems/rqpod-remote-boat-surveying-package/).

# Bathymetry: Data Processing

This section describes how to process bathymetry data collected with the Sontek M9. Bathymetry data need to be collected and processed with [HYPACK MAX software](bathymetry_gettingstarted.qmd).

Waterboards held a training day on 9/10/2024 and recorded the [pre-field](https://cawaterboards.sharepoint.com/:v:/r/sites/WB-DWR-UASProgram/Shared%20Documents/06-Training/ADCP_and_Bathymetry/videos_from_training/Lab%20A_%20Bathymetry%20and%20Hypack%20Software%20-%20Project%20Planning-20240910_090200-Meeting%20Recording.mp4?csf=1&web=1&e=Fnjdmh) and [post-field](https://cawaterboards.sharepoint.com/:v:/r/sites/WB-DWR-UASProgram/Shared%20Documents/06-Training/ADCP_and_Bathymetry/videos_from_training/Lab%20B_%20Bathymetry%20and%20Hypack%20Software%20-%20Data%20Processing-20240910_154319-Meeting%20Recording.mp4?csf=1&web=1&e=15jVn9) training. We also [collected data](https://cawaterboards.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/WB-DWR-UASProgram/Shared%20Documents/06-Training/ADCP_and_Bathymetry/DATA_from_Training/bathymetry_training_data_2024?csf=1&web=1&e=GyU9nt) on the training day that can be used for learning.

## Raw Data

Raw data are stored in the folder [C:\\HYPACK 2024\\Projects]{.underline}.

### Importing data from elsewhere

*This was done in training and may not be relevant to your project.*

If you are copying data from somewhere else, you need to put it in this folder. Some tips to make this work are [recorded here](https://cawaterboards.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/WB-DWR-UASProgram/Shared%20Documents/01-Equipment/03-Manuals%20%26%20Instructions/Sontek_River_Surveyor_(ADCP)/Software/HyPack_Max_Software.docx?d=w0583df0140934d36b843c438ae448af0&csf=1&web=1&e=Nrnr9Z).

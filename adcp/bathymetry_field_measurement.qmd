# Bathymetry: Field Measurement

This section describes how to use the ADCP for bathymetry measurements in the field. The section describes data collection in a stationary body of water, not for streamflow measurements. *add section on collecting bathymetry data in moving water?*

Waterboards held a training day on 9/10/2024 and [recorded the pre-field bathymetry training](https://cawaterboards.sharepoint.com/:v:/r/sites/WB-DWR-UASProgram/Shared%20Documents/06-Training/ADCP_and_Bathymetry/videos_from_training/Lab%20A_%20Bathymetry%20and%20Hypack%20Software%20-%20Project%20Planning-20240910_090200-Meeting%20Recording.mp4?csf=1&web=1&e=sNYZJk).

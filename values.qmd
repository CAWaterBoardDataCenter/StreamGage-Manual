# Values

The following four values are at the core of who we are and how we work:

**We build trust - We adapt - We work in partnership - We drive quality**

See the [OIMA Values Statement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bqsmw-M269x-4P6Lv4vDOLdxKp_zcrl6/view?usp=sharing) for how each of these values have been operationalized into behaviors that we are all empowered, expected, and held accountable to demonstrating.

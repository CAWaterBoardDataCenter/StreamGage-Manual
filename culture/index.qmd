# SWAMP Culture {.unnumbered}

In SWAMP we understand that our culture is a result of our shared core values and our behaviors - and we take actions to support a culture that makes SWAMP a place we want to work.

> Culture is a set of living relationships working towards a shared goal. It's not something you are, it's something you do"

*The Culture Code, Daniel Coyle*

> A culture is strong when people work with each other, for each other. A culture is weak when people work against each other, for themselves.

*Simon Sinek*

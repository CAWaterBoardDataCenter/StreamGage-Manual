    "text": "An Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, or ADCP, uses sound waves to measure depth and the direction and speed of moving water. Frequency determines the depth and precision of the measured data, with higher frequencies having higher precision and lower frequencies with greater depth range. The ADCP is mounted on a platform on the surface of the water and coupled with a compass so that the instrument knows which direction the water is moving. Our ADCP is paired with a GPS-RTK (global positioning system - real time kinematic) with an accuracy of about 2 cm.\nThe ADCP is used in rivers that are deep or large rivers that cannot be waded safely - it may also be used in rivers during the winter, when flows are higher or there are hazards downstream. The ADCP requires water depths of at least 1 ft (2 or more feet is better). The ADCP can also be used to measure the depth to the bottom of a lake (or possibly a river) and map bathymetry.\n\nThis section is aimed at training staff on how to use the ADCP and process the data. For streamflow measurements in wadeable streams, please see the flow measurement section.\n\n\nThe Sontek M9 works to a depth of ~40 m (130 ft), with velocities up to about 20 m/s (66 ft/s). However, actual depths in the field may be limited by vegetation, suspended sediments, uneven topography, or other impediments. The motor, tethering system, moving particles, or the presence of standing waves (rapids) may limit operation in fast-moving water.\n\n\n\nThere is a set of 4 3.0 MHz and 4 1.0 MHz transducers for velocity profiling, and one 0.5 MHz vertical beam for maximum depth. The different frequencies allow for high precision and adequate depth coverage.",

    "text": "There are a few factors to consider when choosing a site to take a flow measurement.\n(Insert an image here)\n\n\nRiver Channel: Look for an area where the channel is straight and uniform, supporting more laminar flow.

Examples are morphological units that constrict flow, such as stable riffles or bedrock outcroppings.\nChannel banks should be stable and not easily susceptible to scouring, deposition, or migration.\n(Upload picture)\nAccess: This may end up being a more limiting factor, but the site chosen will need to be somewhere that can be accessed for data collection or for regular maintenance if a gauge is installed.\n\n\n\nCheck for vegetation and algae growth, or any obstructions such as boulders, branches, or log jams.

This amount is removed from your monthly paycheck. Employees may elect to receive cash in lieu of their state-sponsored medical insurance and/or dental insurance plan through the FlexElect program. You must certify you have qualifying group health and/or dental insurance through a spouse, domestic partner, or other source. FlexElect cash is distributed monthly.\nYou can make changes to your health, dental, and vision insurance selections two ways:\n\nAnnually during open enrollment, which occurs in the fall of each year.

ArcGIS Pro can be downloaded from the Software Center. If you do not see ArcGIS Pro in the Software Center, contact the Help Desk at help@waterboards.ca.gov so that they can add it your list of available applications. Future releases of ArcGIS Pro and other ESRI applications should be automatically added to the Software Center as they are approved by DIT. You can use the Software Center to update your installation. \nThe Water Boards ArcGIS Portal (https://gispublic.waterboards.ca.gov/portal/) is an online platform for publishing and sharing ESRI-produced GIS resources with others at the Water Boards. These resources can also be shared with people outside of the Water Boards (with approval). For those familiar with ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Portal is the enterprise version of ArcGIS Online. With ArcGIS Portal, you can: \n\nCreate and share maps, story maps, and other applications \nSearch for GIS content within the Water Boards \nCreate groups to share GIS information with colleagues \nDownload maps, layers, and GIS data for use in ArcGIS Pro and other applications \n\nTo activate your Water Boards ArcGIS Portal membership (required for viewing, downloading, and publishing resources on the portal), email the DIT GIS Unit at gis@waterboards.ca.gov.  \nTo log into Portal, use the same username and password that you use for your state-issued laptop or computer. \n\nUsername: The default format is “[your work PC login]@EPA” (e.g. jsmith@EPA) OR “epa\\[your work PC login]” (e.g. epa\\jsmith) \nPassword: [your work PC password] \n\nPublic sharing: Resources published on the ArcGIS Portal can be shared outside of the organization to the public (no Portal log-in required), but this requires approval from the DIT GIS Unit. See the Public Sharing Requirements on the GIS Unit wiki (start [gis] (ca.gov)) and ensure that you complete each one of the steps before you submit a completed Public Publishing Form to the GIS Unit. The approval process can take some time, depending on how complex your project is and how busy the GIS Unit staff are, so plan ahead if you are working against a deadline. \nFor more information about ArcGIS Pro and the Water Boards ArcGIS Portal, view the GIS Unit wiki."

Managing multiple projects at once, given our limited resources – time, funding, capacity (i.e. on person can only do so much in a day!) can be challenging – so we like to make time to review all of our projects and prioritize them. This helps us focus our efforts and resources so that we can continue to make progress while also maintaing balance and preventing staff burnout.  \nThere are a couple of different strategic planning moments that occur: \n\nSWAMP Strategic Planning: Every three years or so, the SWAMP Team reviews and updates the SWAMP Strategic Plan to account for changes in priorities and bandwidth.\nProgram Work Plans: Every three years or so, SWAMP Program leads review and update their Program’s Work Plans to account for changes in priorities and bandwidth.\nIndividual Work Plans: In December/January of each year, we recommend taking time to update individual work plans to account for changes in priorities and bandwidth. This is also a good time to review and update Individual Development Plans, if staff have them!"

This timeframe can vary for each Statewide Monitoring Program so it’s best to review each Program’s Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) for specific sampling and processing timelines.\nThe SWAMP Team does so much more than manage and coordinate SWAMP Statewide Monitoring Programs! For those projects, data collection and processing can look very different. Usually it comes in the form of engagement with internal and external partners, listening to the needs of communities that can most benefit from SWAMP data, information, and products, and figuring out how to operationalize and evolve our products and systems to better serve those communities and our partners. This process tends to be ongoing, although there may also be focused and concentrated periods where this listening and learning occurs."

This can be separate from or simultaneous to the engagement and learning described in the “Collect and Process” step above.

    "text": "Overview\nSWAMP sits within the Water Board’s Office of Information Management and Analysis (OIMA), which serves as an advocate for data management, a bridge between data collectors and users, as well as, provides transparency of the Water Board’s information management infrastructure.\n\nThe SWAMP mission is to provide resource managers, decision makers, and the public with timely, high-quality data, information and tools needed to evaluate the condition of all surface waters throughout California.\n\nSWAMP accomplishes this through carefully designed, externally reviewed statewide and regional surface water monitoring programs, and by assisting other entities state-wide in the generation of comparable data that can be brought together in integrated assessments that provide answers to current management questions.\nIn addition to providing information and tools, SWAMP’s vision is to help enhance monitoring, assessment and reporting activities throughout the Water Boards.\n\nSWAMP IQ strives to promote question-driven monitoring, and to ensure the highest quality data is used to evaluate the health of California’s water bodies.\n\nSWAMP IQ assists ambient monitoring projects and programs throughout the state by offering resources that support each stage of water quality monitoring, from sample collection to data entry, as well as providing quality assurance review, verification, and data storage."

If you select health insurance, you will pay the difference between what the state provides for healthcare (a base amount monthly) and the monthly cost for your selected health insurance. This amount is removed from your monthly paycheck. Employees may elect to receive cash in lieu of their state-sponsored medical insurance and/or dental insurance plan through the FlexElect program. You must certify you have qualifying group health and/or dental insurance through a spouse, domestic partner, or other source. FlexElect cash is distributed monthly.\nYou can make changes to your health, dental, and vision insurance selections two ways:\n\nAnnually during open enrollment, which occurs in the fall of each year. Your new insurance selections begin the following January.\nAfter a qualifying event in your life.\n\nTo learn more about the health coverage available to you, please visit the CalPERS website as well as the website for your bargaining unit to learn about costs specific to you.

ArcGIS Pro can be downloaded from the Software Center. If you do not see ArcGIS Pro in the Software Center, contact the Help Desk at help@waterboards.ca.gov so that they can add it your list of available applications. Future releases of ArcGIS Pro and other ESRI applications should be automatically added to the Software Center as they are approved by DIT. You can use the Software Center to update your installation. \nThe Water Boards ArcGIS Portal (https://gispublic.waterboards.ca.gov/portal/) is an online platform for publishing and sharing ESRI-produced GIS resources with others at the Water Boards. These resources can also be shared with people outside of the Water Boards (with approval). For those familiar with ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Portal is the enterprise version of ArcGIS Online. With ArcGIS Portal, you can: \n\nCreate and share maps, story maps, and other applications \nSearch for GIS content within the Water Boards \nCreate groups to share GIS information with colleagues \nDownload maps, layers, and GIS data for use in ArcGIS Pro and other applications \n\nTo activate your Water Boards ArcGIS Portal membership (required for viewing, downloading, and publishing resources on the portal), email the DIT GIS Unit at gis@waterboards.ca.gov.  \nTo log into Portal, use the same username and password that you use for your state-issued laptop or computer. \n\nUsername: The default format is “[your work PC login]@EPA” (e.g. jsmith@EPA) OR “epa\\[your work PC login]” (e.g. epa\\jsmith) \nPassword: [your work PC password] \n\nPublic sharing: Resources published on the ArcGIS Portal can be shared outside of the organization to the public (no Portal log-in required), but this requires approval from the DIT GIS Unit. See the Public Sharing Requirements on the GIS Unit wiki (start [gis] (ca.gov)) and ensure that you complete each one of the steps before you submit a completed Public Publishing Form to the GIS Unit. The approval process can take some time, depending on how complex your project is and how busy the GIS Unit staff are, so plan ahead if you are working against a deadline. \nFor more information about ArcGIS Pro and the Water Boards ArcGIS Portal, view the GIS Unit wiki."

It is place to document institutional knowledge and provide references to available resources.\nThis is a Quarto book, and is in development. If you have suggestions for additions or revisions you think should be incorporated into this book, please follow the guidance provided on the How to contribute chapter."

    "text": "Overview\nSWAMP sits within the Water Board’s Office of Information Management and Analysis (OIMA), which serves as an advocate for data management, a bridge between data collectors and users, as well as, provides transparency of the Water Board’s information management infrastructure.\n\nThe SWAMP mission is to provide resource managers, decision makers, and the public with timely, high-quality data, information and tools needed to evaluate the condition of all surface waters throughout California.\n\nSWAMP accomplishes this through carefully designed, externally reviewed statewide and regional surface water monitoring programs, and by assisting other entities state-wide in the generation of comparable data that can be brought together in integrated assessments that provide answers to current management questions.\nIn addition to providing information and tools, SWAMP’s vision is to help enhance monitoring, assessment and reporting activities throughout the Water Boards.\n\nSWAMP IQ strives to promote question-driven monitoring, and to ensure the highest quality data is used to evaluate the health of California’s water bodies.\n\nSWAMP IQ assists ambient monitoring projects and programs throughout the state by offering resources that support each stage of water quality monitoring, from sample collection to data entry, as well as providing quality assurance review, verification, and data storage."

Check with our HR liaison about switching leave types.\nLeave types are also connected to different types of non-work-related disability leave, which may impact your income should you need to go on disability leave. Non-work-related disability leave types are compared for Unit 10 employees on this flyer. More information about non-work-related disability leave is also available on the EDD website.\nLeave accrual can be impacted by the number of days/hours you work in a month."

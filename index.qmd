# Welcome! {.unnumbered}

This manual is under construction.

This is an online reference and resource written by and for the [Division of Water Rights](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/) at the California State Water Resources Control Board ([State Water Board](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/)).

This manual is written to help train staff in stream gaging, instream flow measurement, and bathymetry measurement. Topics may include equipment, preparation for field work, data collection, data processing, and data storage. It is a place to document institutional knowledge and provide references to available resources.

This [Quarto book](https://quarto.org/docs/books) is an open, living, and continuously iterating resource. If you have suggestions for additions or revisions you think should be incorporated into this book, please follow the guidance provided in the [Contributing](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/StreamGage-Manual/contribute.html) chapter.

## Inspiration

The impetus for developing this manual began in 2024 when some of us participated in the [Water Boards Openscapes Champions Cohort](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/swrcb-openscapes/cohorts/swrcb_2024F.html).

This Manual was started with help from the folks behind the, [SWAMP Manual](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/swamp-manual/), who generously shared their time and code to get us started!

We are also inspired by the following sources:

-   [Openscapes](https://www.openscapes.org/) and their [Approach Guide](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/)
-   [Adrift Field Methods â€“ ADRIFT Field Methods](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/adrift-field-methods/)
-   [NOAA Fisheries (NMFS) Open Science Resource Book](https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/ResourceBook/)
-   [The Fay Lab Manual](https://thefaylab.github.io/lab-manual/)

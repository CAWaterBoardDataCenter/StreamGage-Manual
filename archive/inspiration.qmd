# Inspiration

The impetus for developing this manual began in 2024 when some of us participated in the [Water Boards Openscapes Champions Cohort](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/swrcb-openscapes/cohorts/swrcb_2024F.html).

This Manual was started with help from the folks behind the, [SWAMP Manual](https://cawaterboarddatacenter.github.io/swamp-manual/), who generously shared their time and code to get us started!

We are also inspired by the following sources:

-   [Openscapes](https://www.openscapes.org/) and their [Approach Guide](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide/)
-   [Adrift Field Methods â€“ ADRIFT Field Methods](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/adrift-field-methods/)
-   [NOAA Fisheries (NMFS) Open Science Resource Book](https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/ResourceBook/)
-   [The Fay Lab Manual](https://thefaylab.github.io/lab-manual/)

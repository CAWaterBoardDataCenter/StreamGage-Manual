# SWAMP Life Cycle

All SWAMP activites align with some component of the [data life cycle](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/resources/oima/cowi/data_management_handbook.html), which consists of the seven phases outlined below. Here, we provide resources the SWAMP Team uses to effectively implement each phase.

## Plan and Prepare

The SWAMP Unit, and all of the individuals within it, tend to have a number of co-occurring projects that are meant to help us advance and ultimately achieve our Mission. Managing multiple projects at once, given our limited resources -- time, funding, capacity (i.e. on person can only do so much in a day!) can be challenging -- so we like to make time each year to review all of our projects and prioritize them. This helps us focus our efforts and resources over the coming year.  

There are a couple of different strategic planning moments that occur each year: 

-   **Annual Work Plans**; In December/January, we recommend taking time to update individual work plans to account for changes in priorities and bandwidth

-   **Program Strategic Planning** 

## Collect and Process

## Assure and Analyze

## Preserve and Store

Currently, data and information generated by SWAMP are stored in a number of different places. The SWAMP Team is working on developing a standard and consistent data and document retention system. Until then, the information below is meant to help increase transparency on where things are currently stored.

***Microsoft SharePoint & OneDrive*** 

-   Online storage site used for documents that will be shared and edited with people internal to Water Boards -- avoids version control issues

-   [SWAMP SharePoint](https://cawaterboards.sharepoint.com/sites/OIMA/SWAMP/SitePages/Home.aspx), [SWAMP IQ SharePoint](https://cawaterboards.sharepoint.com/sites/OIMA/SWAMP-IQ/SitePages/Home.aspx), [OIMA SharePoint](https://cawaterboards.sharepoint.com/sites/OIMA/SitePages/Home.aspx)

***Network Drives***

-   SWAMP: S:\\OIMA\\SHARED

-   SWAMP IQ: S:\\OIMA\\SHARED\\QA&DM

    -   Used to store core, static materials dated back to SWAMP IQ's start in 2014.

    -   Archive for old documents and storage for documents we want backed up. 

***Google Drive***

-   Online storage site used for documents that will be posted to the SWAMP and SWAMP IQ Wiki pages

-   Shared and edited with people external to Water Boards

***FTP Site***

-   The [SWAMP FTP Site](https://ftp.waterboards.ca.gov/WebInterface/login.html#/) is used to share large files and to submit field data through data entry shell databases

-   Request the username and password from [OIMA-helpdesk\@waterboards.ca.gov](mailto:OIMA-helpdesk@waterboards.ca.gov)

## Publish and Share

### SWAMP Data

After SWAMP Data are assessed and processed by SWAMP IQ, they are published and stored in the [California Environmental Data Exchange Network](http://ceden.org/index.shtml) (CEDEN), which is also pushed to and available on the [California Open Data Portal](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/surface-water-aquatic-organism-tissue-sample-results).

### SWAMP Information & Products

[***Water Boards Website***](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/)***:*** our main way of sharing information and products to the public

[***SWAMP Wiki***](https://sites.google.com/site/swampwikihomepage/): what we use to share information with our external contractors and collaborators

[***SWAMP Data Dashboard***](https://gispublic.waterboards.ca.gov/swamp-data/): the primary SWAMP data visualization tool

[***GitHub***](https://github.com/CAWaterBoardDataCenter): used to develop and share select SWAMP products (like this Manual!)

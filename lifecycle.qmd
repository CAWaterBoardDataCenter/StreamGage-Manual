# SWAMP Life Cycle

All SWAMP activites align with some component of the [data life cycle](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/resources/oima/cowi/data_management_handbook.html), which consists of the seven phases outlined below. Here, we provide resources the SWAMP Team uses to effectively implement each phase.

## Plan and Prepare

The SWAMP Unit, and all of the individuals within it, tend to have a number of co-occurring projects that are meant to help us advance and ultimately achieve our Mission. Managing multiple projects at once, given our limited resources -- time, funding, capacity (i.e. on person can only do so much in a day!) can be challenging -- so we like to make time each year to review all of our projects and prioritize them. This helps us focus our efforts and resources over the coming year.  

There are a couple of different strategic planning moments that occur each year: 

-   **Annual Work Plans**; In December/January, we recommend taking time to update individual work plans to account for changes in priorities and bandwidth

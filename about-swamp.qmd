# About SWAMP

## Overview

SWAMP sits within the Water Board's Office of Information Management and Analysis (OIMA), which serves as an advocate for data management, a bridge between data collectors and users, as well as, provides transparency of the Water Board's information management infrastructure.

> The SWAMP mission is to provide resource managers, decision makers, and the public with timely, high-quality data, information and tools needed to evaluate the condition of all surface waters throughout California.

SWAMP accomplishes this through carefully designed, externally reviewed statewide and regional surface water monitoring programs, and by assisting other entities state-wide in the generation of comparable data that can be brought together in integrated assessments that provide answers to current management questions.

Statewide SWAMP Monitoring Programs include:

-   [Bioaccumulation Monitoring Program](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/bioaccumulation_monitoring.html)
-   [Bioassessment Program](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/bioassessment/)
-   [Freshwater and Estuarine HABs Program](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/freshwater_cyanobacteria.html)
-   [Toxicology and Contaminants Program](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/swamp/spot/)

In addition to providing information and tools, SWAMP's vision is to help enhance monitoring, assessment and reporting activities throughout the Water Boards.

> SWAMP IQ strives to promote question-driven monitoring, and to ensure the highest quality data is used to evaluate the health of California's water bodies.

SWAMP IQ assists ambient monitoring projects and programs throughout the state by offering resources that support each stage of water quality monitoring, from sample collection to data entry, as well as providing quality assurance review, verification, and data storage.
